This is my git tutorial!

cmd :
initialize git repository in your folder: git init
git status
add files: git add test.txt
typical commit: git commit -m "added some text file with command lines"
fix user info: git config --global --edit
git status
look at the history of your log :  git log

And here goes another commit!
track all files and their changes: git add .

check branch's name: git branch
change branch's name: git branch -m yourNewNameHere
create new branch: git checkout -b featuredName
change to another branch: git checkout anotherBranchName
merge branches: git merge anotherBranchName

merging conflicts (first create conficting commits): git merge anotherBranchName
accept or reject the changes, save and use the commands: git add .
: git commit -m "description of the decisions"


reverting staged commits (one by one reccommended) : git reset --hard HEAD~1

deleting branch: git branch -D BranchToDelete

reestablish the latest well commited state: git checkout -- .
